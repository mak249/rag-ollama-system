## Video Script

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Screen: Show project overview and architecture]**

> "Hello! Today I'll demonstrate a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with a web interface. This system allows you to query your own documents using local AI models - perfect for maintaining data privacy while getting intelligent answers from your documents."

**[Screen: Show project folder structure]**

> "The system consists of a FastAPI backend, a web frontend, and uses Ollama for local AI processing with ChromaDB for vector storage. Let me show you how it works."

---

### Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Show documents in docs/ folder]**

> "Traditional AI models can only answer based on their training data, which may be outdated or lack your specific information. Our RAG system solves this by combining document retrieval with AI generation, all running locally."

**[Screen: Show architecture diagram]**

> "Here's the flow: Documents are processed into embeddings, stored in ChromaDB, and when you ask a question through the web interface, the system retrieves relevant context and generates answers using Ollama's local models."

---

### Implementation Demo (1:00 - 3:30)

#### Step 1: Backend Server (1:00 - 1:20)
**[Screen: Terminal showing backend startup]**

> "First, let's start our FastAPI backend server which handles the RAG processing:"

```bash
.\rag-env\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**[Screen: Show server running successfully]**

> "The server is now running and connected to our pre-populated ChromaDB vector database containing documents about AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and machine learning."

#### Step 2: Web Interface Demo (1:20 - 2:50)
**[Screen: Open browser to localhost:3001]**

> "Now let's access our web interface. This clean, modern interface makes it easy to interact with our RAG system:"

**[Screen: Show the web interface]**

> "Let me demonstrate with several queries:"

**Query 1: AI Fundamentals**
- Type: "What is artificial intelligence and how does it work?"
- Show response with context

> "Notice how the system provides detailed, contextual answers based on our documents."

**Query 2: Cybersecurity**
- Type: "What are the main cybersecurity threats organizations face?"
- Show response

**Query 3: Technical Comparison**
- Type: "Compare supervised and unsupervised machine learning"
- Show response

> "Each response is generated using relevant chunks from our documents, ensuring accuracy and relevance."

#### Step 3: System Features (2:50 - 3:20)
**[Screen: Show error handling and loading states]**

> "The system includes professional features like loading indicators, error handling, and real-time feedback. If the backend is unavailable, users get clear error messages."

**[Screen: Show network tab or backend logs]**

> "All processing happens locally - no data leaves your system, ensuring complete privacy and security."

---

### Results & Benefits (3:20 - 4:00)
**[Screen: Show multiple query results and web interface]**

> "As demonstrated, our RAG system provides accurate, contextual answers through an intuitive web interface. Key benefits include:"

**[Screen: Show benefits visually]**

> "• **Complete Privacy**: All processing happens locally - no external API calls
> • **Cost-Effective**: No per-query charges or subscription fees
> • **User-Friendly**: Modern web interface with real-time feedback
> • **Fast Response**: 2-5 second query processing
> • **Production-Ready**: Error handling, loading states, and robust architecture"

**[Screen: Show project architecture]**

> "The system uses FastAPI for the backend, vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, and integrates seamlessly with Ollama and ChromaDB."

---

### Technical Architecture (4:00 - 4:30)
**[Screen: Show system components]**

> "The architecture consists of three main layers: a web frontend for user interaction, a FastAPI backend for processing, and local AI models for generation. This separation ensures scalability and maintainability."

**[Screen: Show performance metrics]**

> "We've achieved consistent sub-5-second response times while maintaining high accuracy through optimized document chunking and intelligent context retrieval."

---

### Conclusion (4:30 - 5:00)
**[Screen: Final summary with project overview]**

> "This RAG system demonstrates how to build enterprise-ready AI applications using local models and modern web technologies. It's perfect for organizations requiring document intelligence while maintaining complete data privacy."

> "The system is production-ready with proper error handling, user feedback, and scalable architecture. All source code and documentation are included for easy deployment and customization. Thank you for watching!"

## Post-Recording Checklist
- [ ] Review video for clarity and timing
- [ ] Ensure all queries work as shown
- [ ] Check audio quality
- [ ] Verify screen recording captured all actions
- [ ] Export in appropriate format (MP4, 1080p recommended)

---

## Backup Scenarios
**If something goes wrong during recording:**

1. **Ollama not responding**: Have `ollama serve` running in background
2. **Model not found**: Pre-pull all models before recording
3. **Slow responses**: Use smaller models or reduce `num_predict`
4. **File errors**: Ensure all documents are in `docs/` folder

---

## Key Points to Emphasize
- **Local processing** (no external APIs)
- **Privacy and security** (data stays local)
- **Cost effectiveness** (no per-query charges)
- **Easy deployment** (few dependencies)
- **Production ready** (error handling, optimization)
- **Extensible** (easy to add features)
