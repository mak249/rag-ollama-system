Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as problem-solving, speech recognition, and decision-making. Machine learning and deep learning are subfields of AI that focus on enabling machines to learn from data.
